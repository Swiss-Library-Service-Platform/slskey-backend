## Overview

SLSKey is an authentication service originally designed to enable private users (non-affiliated individuals) of universities to access electronic resources that are typically restricted to institution members. Since then, it has expanded to serve institutions that don't operate their own identity provider, allowing them to use [Switch edu-ID](https://eduid.ch/) for authenticating all their users, from students to staff. The accompanying Alma Cloud App empowers librarians to manage SLSKey access rights directly within Alma, seamlessly communicating with this backend to streamline user authorization workflows.

This identity-based approach means users can access resources from anywhere, without needing VPN access. Institutions maintain full control over user access through a web-based management interface, while benefiting from Switch edu-ID's robust authentication infrastructure.
